# Working on Linux Line Commands
### Baby Steps:
1. mkdir -i  name_of_your_src
2. cd 'path/to/destination'

## Operations:
1. File Creation
2. Extracting Time Stamp of the file
3. Copy contents from one file to another or Copy the directory from one
to another
4. Rename and move files
5. Implement gedit/vi commands which we have been using to make our scripts
6. Joining and making wildcards






(P.S.:
  1)I hope you know the logics of cd, ls, tree, touch, cat. If not, this may help https://maker.pro/linux/tutorial/basic-linux-commands-for-beginners
  2) Be sure you're in the place where you want to run the commands, if not then use ```cd 'directory_name'``` in the beginning of the script
